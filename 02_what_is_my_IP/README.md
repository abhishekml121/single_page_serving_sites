# WHAT IS MY IP

**About the web-page**
  - will tell your's IP address
  - It will also tell your proxy IP address (only if you are using)
  - If you use the link in your localhost server like
    http://localhost/whatismyip.php
    then you will not see the IP address using that link.
    So You need to relace the localhost with 127.0.0.1
    hence the link must be in localhost server like
    https://127.0.0.1/whatismyip.php
  - If you are running that page inside of your DOMAIN then it will automatically detect your IP.
